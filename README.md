# Deep Reinforcement Learning survey
This paper list is a bit different from others. I'll put some opinion and summary on it. However, to understand the whole paper, you still have to read it by yourself!   
Surely, any pull request or discussion are welcomed!

## Before Jump into Deep Reinforcement Learning
If you're a newbie in deep reinforcement learning, I suggest you to read the blog post and open course first.
